The SF Nexus aspires to make a comprehensive dataset of science fiction literature. At this time, the most valuable web resources include:
* **[Project Gutenberg]**(https://www.gutenberg.org/): A library containing 70,000+ free ebooks for which U.S. copyright has expired.
* **[Internet Archive]**(https://archive.org/): A non-profit library containing millions of free books, movies, and music, as well as billions of archived web pages; books out of copyright are available to download.
* **[Luminist.org]**(http://www.luminist.org/archives/SF/): A variety of cultural documents, including science fiction, fantasy and "weird fiction," available for download and purhcase: 

Separately, work is ongoing to digitize old paperbacks and pulp magazines at institutions like Temple University Library. This hub will also help to make those copyrighted materials available, for example, as derived datasets of extracted features like those available from HathiTrust. 

For an overview of our approach to data curation of literary texts, see Alex Wermer-Colan's and James Kopaczewski's article, ["The New Wave of Digital Collections: Speculating on the Future of Library Curation"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45420508#metadata_info_tab_contents)(2022)

Further effort will be made to share code for analyzing sf data.
