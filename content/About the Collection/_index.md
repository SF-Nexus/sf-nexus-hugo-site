The SF Nexus aspires to make a comprehensive dataset of science fiction literature. At this time, the most valuable web resources include:
* Project Gutenberg
* Internet Archive
* Luminist.org
* HathiTrust
Below, we outline data available from each of these resouces, and describe future plans to develop a combined dataset.

Separately, work is ongoing to digitize old paperbacks and pulp magazines at institutions like Temple University Library. This hub will also help to make those materials available, for example, as derived datasets of extracted features like those available from HathiTrust. 

For an overview of our approach to data curation of literary texts, see Alex Wermer-Colan's and James Kopaczewski's article, ["The New Wave of Digital Collections: Speculating on the Future of Library Curation"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45420508#metadata_info_tab_contents)(2022)

Further effort will be made to share code for analyzing sf data.
